This is an interface to send live weather data obtained from
the Davis Vantage Vue personal weather station up to the 
weatherundergound.com. Data is transferred via the wundergound
API which is documented here: 
http://wiki.wunderground.com/index.php/PWS_-_Upload_Protocol

A serial interface must be used off of the Vantage Vue, this can
be a wired or wireless interface. A stanfard v1 or v2 Xbee can
be directly fitted to the Vantage Vue, more information is 
available here:
