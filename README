This is an interface to send live weather data obtained from
the Davis Vantage Vue personal weather station up to the 
Weather Underground. Data is transferred via the wunderground
API which is documented here: 
http://wiki.wunderground.com/index.php/PWS_-_Upload_Protocol

A serial interface must be used off of the Vantage Vue, this can
be a wired or wireless interface. A standard v1 or v2 XBee can
be directly fitted to the Vantage Vue, more information is 
available here:

I have made a board that fits into the back of the Vantage Vue PWS
console. The gerbers for this board are included here if you wish
to use it. The board is simple, it can be etched at home. If you 
want to have it professionally made, I recommend oshpark.com.

The local side will also need a USB or serial XBee interface to connect
to the machine or device that will be running the python code. You
can make a simple interface or purchase one from suppliers like
sparkfun.com.

The code to connect to the Vantage Vue is wrote in python. The easiest 
method for executing is to run it via a cron job for periodic updates
to wunderground.com. If using the wundergound rapid fire servers,
the bash script here can be used to upload data every 10 seconds. 

A note on compatibility. This code and hardware has been tested on the
Davis Vantage VUE PWS console with firmware version 2.x. There are 
reports that the firmware version 3.0 and higher has the serial 
interface disabled preventing use of serial communication. Please 
check your firmware version. The API for other Davis weather stations
is nearly identical to the Vantage VUE, this code should work for
other Davis models with little or no modification.
